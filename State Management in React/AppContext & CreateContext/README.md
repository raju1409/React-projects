Here if we we have attributes to pass to a component in react we use Props 

if in case the attributes we pass to a different components are *MORE we can use useContext

with the help of createContext() we create own context like Appcontext and use created <Appcontext> component 
  which hold values of states or variables with help of Values passes to this component
  
  
By maknig that compoenent Global means Export we can use that AppContext to use states wich we passes to it while creating 
  and we can use it in any file and component which more usefull and easy
